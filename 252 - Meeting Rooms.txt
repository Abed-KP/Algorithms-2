I was reminded of the power of Comparators. Also, a good technique is to learn to "Corner" your program int a wall, so that

you can use if statements to generate the right answer. Cornering leads to an 'either this' and "if this happens, then

that can't happen, and nothing else can happen." Thinking like this allows you to solve so many problems.
