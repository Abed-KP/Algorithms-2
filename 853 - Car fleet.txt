I learned a couple things here. Casting for instance, all it involves is typing "( type name )" before value.

I also learned to think this: "What other factors in this question can give me the answer. In this case, it was calculating

the time, and checking, 'Hey, if this car was in an earlier position, but finished before with its given sped than the car

ahead it, then it must have collided at some point.
